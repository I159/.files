### VIM build and dot files for Go and Python development

It is built in appropriate to a "combine and create" principle. There are included some useful plugins and indentation script.
Thanks to maintainers of all the great stuff I found and included to my working toolset.

Features:

* Custom PS1 for cozy git status display
* GIT config, mostly for colored GIT output (I don't like aliases so there is no of them)
* Well organized VIM config with mappings and settings
* File type plugins for Go and Python
* And plugins. All in one for Go and several for Python.
